            Our Sunday School ministry is well organized and now we have a
            systematic Sunday School system with over 9 teachers including
            substitute teachers and several classes from Nursery to 10th grade.
            All our Sunday School teachers are well educated and experienced in
            teaching ministry, especially the Word of God in full authority. We
            follow the IPC Sunday school syllabus.

            It is our goal as a church to teach the word of God to our children,
            leading and guiding them in the right direction in accordance with
            the Word of God (Bible) equipping them to become leaders and
            teachers in the future to fulfil the Great Commission of our Lord
            and Saviour Lord Jesus Christ.
